# EdgeCards

### üìå Overview
The Edge Cards project is an end-to-end mobile banking application that will provide Edge customers a safe and secure platform to facilitate their financial transaction. The app will allow clients to apply for Edge cards, manage their virtual wallets, keep track of transactions, and have access to advance financial features such as budget capabilities and reward plans.

This application is built on a microservice architecture to enable high availability, scalability, security, and system transparency, with feature extensibility and less rework. The application is built for Android and iOS platforms and has integrations with leading financial services providers such as KCB Bank and Mpesa.

The application was built in three phases to deploy basic wallet capabilities first, followed by advanced features and merchant integrations.
